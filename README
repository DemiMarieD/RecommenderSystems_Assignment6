What we have here:

    templates folder: you find the html code for the to pages

    ex6 folder:
        > forms is used to define the input form for the User ID
        > operations here are the logic / calculations / the connection to the data
        > urls here the url of the two pages is def. so to call the first page use /welcome
        > views here we render the html pages accordingly

        > the other files were not touched by me.

REMARK: I'm not sure if this is the right/best structuring so you may restructure if you know better.

TODO: We still need to implement making the recommendations. + We need to make it look much nicer!
