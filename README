Assignment 6 - Group 1: Demi Dauerer, Eda Muka and Sebastian Lubos 
We are currently using the PyCharm IDE.

Please make sure to follow the following steps:

1. Install all the requirements to run that project:
    > pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the project:
    PycharmProjects\ex6>  python manage.py runserver 8080
        You should see now:
        Watching for file changes with StatReloader
        Performing system checks...

I build a redirect so localhost:8080/ redirects to http://localhost:8080/welcome/ automatically
If it is still not working maybe also try a different port (than 8080) in case this port is not available.
